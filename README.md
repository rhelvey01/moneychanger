# 💱 MoneyChanger

**MoneyChanger** is a demo application built while completing a LinkedIn Learning course on **GPT APIs and function calling**.

The project showcases how to:

- Use OpenAI GPT models with **function calling**
- Detect when a user wants to exchange currency
- Execute a **separate external API call** to perform the conversion
- Otherwise, return a normal **LLM assistant response**

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💬 Intelligent GPT-powered responses
- 🌐 Automatic currency-exchange workflow
- 🔧 Function-calling with structured outputs
- 🔁 Separation between **LLM reasoning** and **API execution**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- OpenAI GPT API (Function Calling)
- Python 
- ExchangeRate API

---

## 📌 How It Works

User asks something like: exchange 55 GPB to USD. GPT returns USD amount or GPT response if not an exchange quesiton.
